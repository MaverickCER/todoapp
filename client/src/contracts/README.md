# contracts

This folder is a centralized collection of constants, types, and interfaces that are shared throughout the application. These items serve as the "contract" between different parts of the system, ensuring consistency in shared data structures and values. While colocation of such definitions is generally preferred, this folder is used for definitions that need to be accessed by multiple parts of the application.
