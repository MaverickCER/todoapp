# Full-Stack Todo List App

This project is a full-stack Todo List application built using **Next.js**, **Express.js**, **Prisma**, **MySQL**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It features basic CRUD operations for tasks, including creating, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed or not completed.

## Project Overview

- **Front-End**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Back-End**: Express.js with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: MySQL
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS
- **Technologies**: TypeScript

## Features

### 1. Home View

- Displays a list of tasks with **Title**, **Checkbox/Toggler** for completed status, and a **Delete Button**.
- Shows a summary of tasks: `"Tasks: X"`, `"Completed: Y of X"`.
- Task cards are clickable, leading to the **Edit Task Page**.
- **Create Task** button navigates to the task creation form.

### 2. Create/Edit Task Page

- **Form** with fields:
  - **Title** (required)
  - **Color** (selectable options: red, blue, green)
- **Create Task**: Adds a new task and redirects to the Home View.
- **Edit Task**: Updates an existing task and redirects to the Home View.
- Tasks can be discarded if the user navigates back without saving.

### 3. Additional Features

- Toggle a taskâ€™s completion status directly from the Home View.
- Delete tasks with a confirmation prompt before removal.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. **Back-End** (Express.js with Prisma)

- **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone <your-repo-url>
  cd backend
  ```

- **Install Dependencies**:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Configure Database**:

  - Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
  - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

  ```env
  DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/todo_app"
  ```

- **Run Database Migrations**:

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  ```

- **Start the Server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- The API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. **Front-End** (Next.js with Tailwind CSS)

- **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone <your-repo-url>
  cd frontend
  ```

- **Install Dependencies**:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Start the Development Server**:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- The front-end will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Schema (Prisma)

The `Task` model in `schema.prisma` looks as follows:

```prisma
model Task {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  color     String
  completed Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## API Endpoints

The back-end provides the following API routes:

- `GET /tasks`: Fetches a list of all tasks.
- `POST /tasks`: Creates a new task.
- `PUT /tasks/:id`: Edits an existing task.
- `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Deletes a task.

## Front-End Structure

### Pages

- **Home Page (`/`)**: Displays a list of tasks with options to toggle completion status, edit, or delete tasks. Includes a task summary.
- **Create Task Page (`/tasks/create`)**: A form to add new tasks.
- **Edit Task Page (`/tasks/:id`)**: A form to edit an existing task.

### Components

- **TaskCard**: Displays task details and provides interaction options (mark complete, delete, navigate to edit page).
- **TaskForm**: A reusable form component used for both creating and editing tasks.
- **TaskSummary**: Displays the task summary on the home page.

### UI & Styles

Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a clean, responsive UI. Key design considerations include:

- **Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts smoothly for various screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: `TaskCard` and `TaskForm` are designed to be reusable.

## How to Use

1. **Home View**: You will see the list of tasks with checkboxes for completion status. You can create, edit, or delete tasks.
2. **Create/Edit Task**: You can create or edit tasks through the forms. The title is required, and you can select a color for each task.
3. **Toggle Task Completion**: On the Home View, you can toggle the task's completion status with a checkbox.
4. **Delete Task**: You will be prompted for confirmation before deleting a task.

## GitHub Repositories

- **Frontend**: [Frontend Repository Link]
- **Backend**: [Backend Repository Link]

## Project Setup

### Steps for Database Initialization (Prisma)

1. Clone the backend repository.
2. Ensure that MySQL is running and create a database for the project.
3. Add the correct `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file.
4. Run Prisma migration to set up the database tables.
5. Start the backend server.

### Steps for Running the Frontend

1. Clone the frontend repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the Next.js app using `npm run dev`.
4. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
