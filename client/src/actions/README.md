# actions
This folder is a collection of server-side functions or operations in Next.js that perform specific tasks within the backend of the application. Unlike API routes which are exposed to external requests (i.e., accessible via HTTP requests), actions are typically used for server-side logic that is only executed within the application itself. These actions are not directly accessible to clients or external network requests, ensuring more control over the application's flow and access security.

In essence, actions are server-side functions that are executed in response to events, form submissions, background tasks, or interactions from the client but are not directly exposed via HTTP endpoints.
