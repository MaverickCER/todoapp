# hooks
This folder is a collection of custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic, such as handling window events or managing contexts. These hooks simplify complex functionality, making it easier to integrate and reuse across the application. By abstracting logic into hooks, you can minimize complexity in components and ensure consistency in behavior.
